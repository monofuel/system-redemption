# Economy Comparison

- EVE Online
  - faucets
    - missions
    - bounties
  - sinks
    - taxes
    - insurance
  - PLEX
    - players can sell plex, but that doesn't introduce more isk to the market
  - station markets are discoverable.
    - may have to travel to find what you want, but not too hard
  - can own 'shares' of a corp, that may pay dividends
    - does anyone ever actually do this?
- Wurm

  - faucet
    - buy silver for $$
    - (rarely) find money in-game
  - sinks
    - premium
    - village ownership
  - markets are hard to find / not always stocked well
    - lots of travel
    - not very discoverable

- entropia
  - faucet
    - buy PED for $$
  - sinks
    - like, everything.
  - playstyle is to 'be eco' by using gear that returns more than you spend (but is very grindy / not fun)
  - can own 'shares' of land, and get paid taxes for it
